#Git to SVN migration

##Starting point
----------IDEAS-----------
- migrate to what? DVCS for sure, but which?
  -> git, bazar, mercurial => why git
- Statistics: How many projects, users
- git knowledge of users
- OS mix: windows / mac / Linux
- user mix: command line geeks and gui freaks
----------IDEAS-----------

##Git server setup
----------IDEAS-----------
- setups we considered
  * gitosis
  * gitolite
  * gitorious
- how to configure and adapt gitorious
----------IDEAS-----------


#Migration process
----------IDEAS-----------
- not possible to do all at once, only incremental steps
- why it's easier to include the history
- what is possible to automate?
- branches, tags?
- different svn layouts (trunk, branches, tags vs multiple projects in one trunk)
- scripts we used
- svn:ignore -> gitignore + github/gitignore
  * different setup for .NET, PHP, Ruby, HTML
----------IDEAS-----------

#Migrate your users
----------IDEAS-----------
- gui tools needed
- small incremental steps
- playgrounds suck
----------IDEAS-----------

#Conclusion
----------IDEAS-----------
- same same but different or was it worth the effort?
- are things better or worse?
- what is missing now?
- external collaboration
----------IDEAS-----------
