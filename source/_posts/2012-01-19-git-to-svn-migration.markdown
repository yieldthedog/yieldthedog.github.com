##Starting point
----------IDEAS-----------
- migrate to what? DVCS for sure, but which?
  -> git, bazar, mercurial => why git
- Statistics: How many projects, users
- git knowledge of users
- OS mix: windows / mac / Linux
- user mix: command line geeks and gui freaks
----------IDEAS-----------

##Git server setup
----------IDEAS-----------
- setups we considered
  * gitosis
  * gitolite
  * gitorious
- how to configure and adapt gitorious
----------IDEAS-----------


##Migration process 
----------IDEAS-----------
- not possible to do all at once, only incremental steps
- why it's easier to include the history
- what is possible to automate?
- branches, tags?
- different svn layouts (trunk, branches, tags vs multiple projects in one trunk)
- scripts we used
- svn:ignore -> gitignore + github/gitignore
  * different setup for .NET, PHP, Ruby, HTML
----------IDEAS-----------

Because our code base is that large, a migration over the
weekend was not possible. It had to be done in chunks. First
we needed a list of all repos and persons, who where
responsible for the repo. `svn ls --xml` was our friend,
which gave as an easy to transform output of all repos with
last committer names. That was good for a start.

It soon became apparent that we have some clients with lot
of projects and many clients with less than 5 projects. The
latter was no a problem, but the former had no good
structure and naming conventions in the Subversion
repository. We knew for sure that we did not want to migrate
and end up with the same mess as before. So way layed aside
all clients with lots of projects for discussion and
reorganization.

Next we defined, which projects should be migrated with
history and which not. This was a useless discussion,
because it was easier to always migrate with history, as you
will see later.

Our first steps were trying to migrate by hand:

{% codeblock lang:bash %}
git svn clone [svn url] [repo name]        #clone the svn repo to a git repo
git remote add gitorious [gitorious url]   #add a remote to the git server
git push gitorious master                  #push the repo to the server

# done ... hurray ... no wait ....
{% endcodeblock %}


BIG FAIL

What had we missed?

  - no users / usernames
  - no ignores
  - wrong file structure

So lets fix this step by step.

###Users

The users could be mapped rather easily from subversion to git in our case.
Subversion got the users first and last name and Git uses the uses email
address which in our case is the initial of the first name,
a dot, the last name @ our domain. Some times the Subversion
user had only a first name, but these were only rather old records, so they
could be easily ignored. We ended up writing a small Ruby script, that did the work

{% codeblock lang:ruby %}
#!/usr/bin/ruby
name = ARGV[0].split('.')

if(name.length == 1)
  puts name[0] + " <"+ name[0].downcase + "@DOMAIN>"
else
  puts name[0] + " " + name[1] + " <"+ name[0][0].chr.downcase + '.' +name[1].downcase+"@DOMAIN>"
end
{% endcodeblock %}

Now we can call `git svn clone` with this authors.rb file like this:


{% codeblock lang:bash %}
git svn clone --authors-prog=author.rb [subversion url]
{% endcodeblock %}

##Ignores

Next step is to define standard git ignores for projects and to migrate the existing svn ignores over to git ignores. The [Github gitignore project](https://github.com/github/gitignore), which we disected, combined, stripped,â€¦ until we had a default gitignore file. With these two commands we added the defaults and extracted the subversion ignores into a gitignore file:

{% codeblock lang:bash %}
# generate gitignore file
cat PATH_TO/default_gitignore.txt > .gitignore
git svn show-ignore >> .gitignore

#add it to the repository
git add .gitignore
git commit -m'added gitignores'
{% endcodeblock %}



#Migrate your users
----------IDEAS-----------
- gui tools needed
- small incremental steps
- playgrounds suck
----------IDEAS-----------

#Conclusion
----------IDEAS-----------
- same same but different or was it worth the effort?
- are things better or worse?
- what is missing now?
- external collaboration
----------IDEAS-----------
