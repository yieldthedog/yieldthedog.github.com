## CSS

- **[Name Your SASS Variables Modularly](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/quick-tip-name-your-sass-variables-modularly/?utm_source=CSS-Weekly)**
    <small>When working with CSS preprocessors like Sass, Less (or any other programming language for that matter) you’re going be leveraging the power of variables. However, if you spontaneously create your variable names as you code, the odds are your naming convention will lack cohesiveness. You should think about organizing your variable names (and project for that matter) modularly. This will bring structure and unity to your project as a whole, making it easier to understand and navigate the whole thing.</small>
- **[Digging into my slides about Sass](http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/07/08/digging-into-my-slides-sass/)**
    <small>When you just get started with Sass, you don't really know what to do. So you declare a couple of variables, maybe make a mixin or two that you don't really need and that's pretty much it.</small>

- **[Height equals width with pure CSS](http://www.mademyday.de/css-height-equals-width-with-pure-css.html)**
    <small>I was looking for a solution for flexible elements which remain the aspect ratio when resized. Until now I used some Javascript for resizing the elements. But using the resize event and recalculate the height of an element is some kind of nasty and never felt right. Recently I found a solution in an article from A List Apart and a topic on StackOverflow, which works quite well.</small>

- **[David Nolen: ClojureScript: Lisp's Revenge on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/68334908)**
    <small>Once upon a time Google Web Toolkit stood relatively alone as a production quality solution for compiling a different language (Java) to JavaScript. However today we can also choose TypeScript or Dart, both languages designed specifically for "programming in the large" that are backed by big companies. We also have more grass roots offerings like CoffeeScript which has seen quite a bit of traction among web developers. But these solutions are not really as different as they seem. In this talk we'll see how ClojureScript offers a genuinely futuristic approach (by way of the past!) to client side software development.</small>
