First of all I have to admit that I'm an IDE guy. I'm using command line tools, Vi , have gnu tools installed on my Windows box and so on. That brings me to the next thing I have to admit: I'm using Windows.

I love using [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for tinkering with Node.js. I love WebStorm for two reasons:

* The JavaScript syntax completion is somehow crazy clever
* It allows me to stick with my Eclipse keyboard schema

<!-- more -->

The latter point is particullary important to me, since I'm using Eclipse and Visual Studio in my job environment and I don't have enough brain to remember a third keyboard shortcut schema. I guess, I'll blog about that in a future post.

I was using [Nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit) for (unit) testing, when I started with Node.js. While Nodeunit works quite fine, it's limited to TDD style tests. Some time ago when coding on [SubSonic](http://subsonicproject.com) I began to like the endorsed test method name syntax in the project, that uses the word *"should"* somewhere in the test method name. That means a unit test, that was named `testSquareRootOfZero` would become `squareRootOfZeroShouldThrowAnException`. This transports more meaning than `testSquareRootOfZero`. As a side effect of this naming schema I was programming (unit) tests slick like chicken shit. For this reason and for pure curiosity I migrated some unit tests to [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) that offers a slick BDD style syntax just out of the box.

But I had a slight problem with the Mocha tests in WebStorm: lack of tools support. This does not really matter for writing the tests nor for running the tests (Mocha has a wonderful console test runner!). But when tests start to fail, I want to attach a debugger! And I want to attach my WebStorm debugger with a ton of cool features!

So with a little bit of hand crafting and reading Mocha code it's quite easy to attach the WebStorm debugging tools to Mocha tests.

**First install Mocha**

    npm install mocha

You may want to install Mocha globally 

    npm -g install mocha 

**Next attach the debugger:**  

In WebStorm via `Run->Edit Configurations` add a new configuration and point the "Path to node App JS File" to `\_mocha` (can be found under node\_modules in case installed locally or under global modules). Pointing the run configuration to \_mocha is quite important since the main mocha binary spawns a new process you cannot connect via a debugger!

Et voil√† - Debugging Mocha tests in WebStorm!

Drawbacks: The output is somehow broken, so I'm using the WebStorm runner for debugging while using the mocha console runner for pretty output and continuous tests via watch.
